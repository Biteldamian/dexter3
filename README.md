## Features

### Core Capabilities
- ü§ñ **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Orchestrates multiple AI models (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity)
- üìÅ **Smart File Management**: Indexes and organizes files with metadata extraction
- üîç **Advanced Search**: Full-text and semantic search across documents
- üß† **Knowledge Base**: Builds and maintains a searchable knowledge repository
- üéØ **Task Orchestration**: Executes AI-powered tasks using multiple agents

### Agent System
- **Coordinator Agent**: Ollama-based central orchestrator
- **Specialized Agents**: OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity for specific tasks
- **Task Router**: Intelligent task delegation based on agent capabilities
- **Knowledge Aggregation**: Combines insights from multiple agents

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm 9.x or higher
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) installed locally
- API keys for:
  - OpenAI (optional)
  - Anthropic (optional)
  - Perplexity (optional)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dexter.git
cd dexter
\`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:
\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

3. Configure environment variables:
\`\`\`bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
\`\`\`

4. Start the development server:
\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

## Configuration

### Agent Configuration
- **Ollama Setup**: Configure local LLM models
- **API Integration**: Set up cloud AI service connections
- **Task Routing**: Customize agent selection criteria
- **Knowledge Base**: Configure storage and indexing options

### File Management
- **Watch Folders**: Set directories to monitor
- **File Types**: Configure supported file formats
- **Indexing Rules**: Customize metadata extraction
- **Search Settings**: Configure search behavior

## Architecture

### Components
- **Agent System**: Multi-agent coordination framework
- **File Manager**: File operations and indexing
- **Knowledge Base**: SQLite-based information storage
- **Task Orchestrator**: Task distribution and execution
- **Web Interface**: React-based user interface

### Data Flow
1. User submits task/query
2. Coordinator assesses requirements
3. Task Router selects appropriate agents
4. Agents execute sub-tasks
5. Results synthesized and stored
6. Response presented to user
